Project #1

Concept: "Around The World" game is designed for people who want to test their knowledge in Geography and test how well they know the capitals of the countries or for those who want to learn the capitals.

Stakeholder: Natalia Larina

#**Technologies used in creating this game:**#

* HTML5
* CSS
* JavaScript
* jQuery
* API
* Ajax
* Skeleton

#**How to play the game:**#
###To start the game:###
When the page is loaded you will see the airplane flying on the map. After it stops, press ```Let's Play``` button to start the game.
###During the game:###
As soon as you hit ```Let's Play``` button the timer will be on and you will have one minute to see how many capitals you can guess right. When the country is displayed you will see four answers below it. You have to choose the right capital and click on the button. If you guess it right you will see the score board and the correct board changed +1 point. If you guess it wrong you will see the wrong board +1. After you make a choice it should give you the new country to guess and the new choice of answers. If you don't know the answer or it doesn't change to the next country please use the ```Next``` button to move on.
###At the end of the game:###
When the timer is up you will see the alert window saying that the game is over and giving you your final score of correct answers.
You can still keep playing without timer by pressing ```Next``` button. If you want a timer on you have to press ```Let's Play``` again.
###Technical problems you should be aware of:###
The API I have is not that great, sometimes it is missing some capitals or have some of them wrong. So if you don't see the right answer sometimes just skip that country and go to the next one. Also it has 247 countries instead of 196 existing ones, which means it includes all islands and some countries which maybe you never heard of. Please don't get frustrated and just go to the next one. I am planning to find a better API in the future and replace it. ```Previous``` button doesn't work yet.
###Message from creator:###
I love traveling and and learning about new places around the world and I hope my game will help you to learn too!

##Future plans##
I want to make a round of 30 questions in one game and make it
clear for the player by adding more alerts. It will say: "You have one minute to guess 30 capitals" I will add a number of questions  asked to the score button, so the players will know how many they guessed out of what amount of questions. I will give my players an option not to use a timer at all if they don't want to.

I want to make my game more interesting and give the players a chance to choose which part of the world they want to choose to guess from. They will still have an option to guess capitals for the whole world.
I want to add a feature that when the country displayed for them to guess the capital for it will also be highlighted on the map so they will know exactly where it is.
Later I will add an option of exploring the country and if they click on it they can see the pictures and the close up map of the country and its main cities.
